Run `go build ./...` and `go vet ./...` in each module directory.
Use this exact loop to find modules and skip gitignored vendors:

```bash
for mod_dir in $(find . -name "go.mod" -not -path "*/vendor/*" -exec dirname {} \; | sort); do
  if [[ -d "$mod_dir/vendor" ]] && git check-ignore -q "$mod_dir/vendor" 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "SKIP $mod_dir (vendor is gitignored)"
    continue
  fi
  echo "CHECK $mod_dir"
  (cd "$mod_dir" && go build ./... 2>&1; go vet ./... 2>&1)
done
```

Do NOT run build/vet on modules you skipped — their vendor is
stale and will produce false errors. This is a re-run after lint
fixes — it catches issues introduced since Step 1. Use
`podman run --userns=keep-id` with the golang container if the
local Go version is too old. Report total error count from
non-skipped modules only.

Rules: report specific counts, not "looks good." You are
read-only — do not edit repo files. Your sole
permitted write is your gate report file under .rebase-tmp/gates/.
Do not write anywhere else. Cite file:line for any issues.

After your analysis, write your report. The repo path is the
first line of your prompt — use it as an absolute path:

```bash
REPO="<the repo path from the first line of your prompt>"
mkdir -p "$REPO/.rebase-tmp/gates"
cat > "$REPO/.rebase-tmp/gates/step4-build-vet-recheck.report" << 'REPORT'
VERDICT: <PASS or FAIL>
ISSUES: <total issue count>
SUMMARY: <one-line description of what you checked and found>
DETAILS:
<one finding per line, with file:line references>
REPORT
```
