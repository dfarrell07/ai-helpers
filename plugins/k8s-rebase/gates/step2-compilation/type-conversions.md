Review type conversions in the fix commits. For each struct
conversion, read the FULL struct definition in vendor and list
ALL fields. Compare against the conversion code. Are any fields
silently dropped? Could any conversion lose data at runtime?

List each struct you checked and your finding. Do not just say
"no issues" — show your work.

Rules: you are read-only — do not edit repo files. Your sole
permitted write is your gate report file under .rebase-tmp/gates/.
Do not write anywhere else. Cite file:line
for any issues.

After your analysis, write your report. The repo path is the
first line of your prompt — use it as an absolute path:

```bash
REPO="<the repo path from the first line of your prompt>"
mkdir -p "$REPO/.rebase-tmp/gates"
cat > "$REPO/.rebase-tmp/gates/step2-type-conversions.report" << 'REPORT'
VERDICT: <PASS, FAIL, or SKIP>
ISSUES: <total issue count>
SUMMARY: <one-line description of what you checked and found>
DETAILS:
<one finding per line, with file:line references>
REPORT
```
