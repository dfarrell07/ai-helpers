Count go.mod files where k8s.io/* dependency versions are
inconsistent (different minor versions across k8s.io packages
within the same go.mod). For each module with a vendor/ directory, verify
vendor is in sync with go.mod (check vendor/modules.txt).
Also run `go mod verify` in vendored modules to check vendor
consistency mechanically.
Report inconsistency count.

VERDICT criteria: FAIL if any k8s.io/* dependency version is
inconsistent with the target version. PASS if all versions are
consistent.

NEVER run `go mod tidy`, `go get`, `go mod vendor`, or any
command that modifies go.mod/go.sum/vendor. Allowed: `go build`,
`go vet`, `go test` (with `-mod=vendor` if vendor/ exists),
`go mod verify`, `go doc`, `go install <tool>@<version>`,
`go clean -cache`. Fix-hint commands in report text are fine.

Rules: report specific counts, not "looks good." You are
read-only — do not edit repo files. Your sole
permitted write is your gate report file under .rebase-tmp/gates/.
Do not write anywhere else. Cite file:line for any issues.

After your analysis, write your report using the helper script.
The repo path is the first line of your prompt:

```bash
REPO="<the repo path from the first line of your prompt>"
bash "$(find "$HOME/.claude" "$HOME" -maxdepth 7 -name "write-gate-report.sh" -path "*/k8s-rebase/scripts/*" 2>/dev/null | head -1)" \
  "$REPO" step2-version-consistency PASS 0 "your one-line summary" \
  "detail line 1" "detail line 2"
```

Use PASS, FAIL, or SKIP as the verdict. Replace the summary and
details with your actual findings.
